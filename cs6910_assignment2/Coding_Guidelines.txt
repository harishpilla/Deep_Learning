In order to ensure good coding guidelines we added this file to the project.

Guidelines for writing code:
----------------------------
1. Always ensure that the comments are written ahead of the action.
   For e.g. # Set Value to False
            Value = False
2. Ensure the code in master branch is clean without any debug code.
3. Please contact the product owner incase of Pull Requests.
4. Strictly follow the good coding practices and nuances of python community.
