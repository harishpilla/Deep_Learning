# Part C: Using a pre-trained model
----------------------------------------------------
We used a pre-trained YoloV3 model and use it in an application to detect images in a video.

# Alerting Drivers to slow down when an animal crosses the road #
----------------------------------------------
Our demo application is to alert the drivers to slow down while driving a vehicle when an animal crosses the road. Also, an autonomous vehicle should be able to detect animals to avoid accidents.<br/>


As many roads cut through forest and sanctuaries, we would like to slow down the speed of vehicles by detecting animals while they are crossing the roads. This would significantly reduce accidents with animals. 

We used a pre-trained YoloV3 model where the model takes a video as an input and detects the object to be Animals/Persons/Cars. As the world is moving towards Autonomous vehicles, developing these kind of models/applications is vital. Currently, the model we used has the capability to detect animals like Cow, Bear, Dog, Horse, Bird, Elephant, Cat , etc.,
